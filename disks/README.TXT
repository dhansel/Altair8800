The disks and hard disk images in this directory were created by Mike Douglas 
of altairclone.com. Some can be found in the support/downloads area of the
altair clone web site, others come from the Mike's personal web site at deramp.com


More info about the hard disk images in this directory:
The images are sector-by-sector representations of the data on the hard disks,
in the order in which Martin Eberhard's ADEXER tool's XD command would send them:
  cylinder 0 head 0 sector 0..24
  cylinder 0 head 1 sector 0..24
  cylinder 1 head 0 sector 0..24
  cylinder 1 head 1 sector 0..24
  ...
  cylinder 405 head 0 sector 0..24
  cylinder 405 head 1 sector 0..24
